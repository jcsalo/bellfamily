## Ephesians 4: Instructions to Families

### Domestic Relationships in Roman culture

Aristotle Politics: Household management in its perfect form: master + slave, husband + wife, 

449BC - Law on 12 Tablets

Pater Familia - held power of life and death for household members

### Ephesians 4

Paul didn't invent Roman household code. Instructions are given first to wives, then husbands (pater familias), then children.  Addressing wives first was unheard of in Roman society.

### Marriage types

- With the hand - Man brings a women into his home (and she is subject to him) - 50%
- without the hand - Wife is not under husband's authority

### Instructions to husbands

Husbands - Agapao - love without expecting anything in return. This was revolutionary in Roman culture, which was highly transactional. Many marriages were politically expedient

Work for master - LORD: Kuios

### Slavery 

Paul couldn't abolish slavery, as the whole economy of the Roman Empire depended upon slavery.

### Instructions to children

Children - when asked to obey - assumes agency
