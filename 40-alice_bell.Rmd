# Alice Bell

Alice Bell was born July 30, 1923 to Carrie Cox Bell and John William Bell on a farm in Boone County, Indiana adjacent to her grandfather Bell's farm.  Subsequent to the death of her great-grandfather on her mother's side, Clark Millikan, her family moved to a farm in Hamilton County outside Sheridan, Indiana.  She grew up with John Dudley Bell and half-sisters Dora Katherine (Walker) and Rosemary (Hockett).

## Move to Hamilton County

Carrie's grandfather Clark Millikan had owned a farm in Hamilton County, Indiana since 1865.  After Clark's death in 1926, an 80-acre parcel was offered for sale.  John and Carrie Bell sold the farm in Boone County and moved to Clark's farm in 1929. John and Carrie Bell took out a mortgage to purchase the farm in Hamilton County.  Over the years, it bothered Carrie quite severely to carry a debt, even for the farm.  They subsequently bought an additional 17 acre triangle, to make a total of 97 acres.



## Clark Millikan

In 1862 the Confederate Congress did enact a five-hundred-dollar exemption fee, which many Quakers paid, but some did not. Payment of this fee excused a person from military service. In 1864 the Quakers also received approval to perform certain types of work as a substitute for military service. One type of service was working at the saltworks in Wilmington. Another was laboring in the leather tanning and shoe industries, which Quakers owned. From [NCPedia](https://www.ncpedia.org/quakers-and-their-war-resistance)

After the war, Abraham Lincoln resetteled Confererate deserters.

Traded farms with his cousin, who owned a frma in Hamilton County, Indiana.  The cousin's wife had recently died, leaving him with 2 small children.  The cousin was eager to return to North Carolina where he had family who could him him raise his children.  Clark Millikan's farm in Randolph County, NC was a developed, working farm, and the 80 acres in Hamilton County, IN contained only 8 acres of cleared land. The farm in Randolph county consisted of 207 acres of tilled land.  Clark's cousin offered 400 dollars to make up the difference in value of the two farms.

The 80 acres was located in the Southwest corner of Adams Township in Hamilton county.  Finley creek ran though the farm in a north-south direction.  The land was originally granted to Asa Bales in the 1800s as an original land grant.  In 1899, the land plats show the land was owned by George M--- who worked as a barber in Westfield, Indiana.

Carrie gave John D and Alice 80 acres of land each in 1963.  Mom got 80 acres of Clark's land.  John was living on the other 80 acres, so John got the 80 acres he was living on it.

At time of carrie's death, there was additional land. Mom elected to let John D buy all the rest (from the estate).  Carrie had bought Stewart place, and place Emmil Hammock had farmed. She also bought were new house was, 35 or 50 acres.
