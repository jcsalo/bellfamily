#### Artemis Temple

Ephesus was temple keeper (neokoros) for Artemis.  Temple was largest in the world, of which only a solitary column remains.  Off North end of Mt Pion headed towards mount Ayasoluk.  Temple located outside city gates because by legnd a meteor fell from the sky in a swampy area. Birthplace of Artemis was behind Mount Coressus in Mount Ortygia.

## Paul in Ephesus:

Acts 18:18-21

>Paul stayed many days, set sail (from Corinth) with Aquilla and Priscilla.

Paul was trying to come to Ephesus, but was prevented by the Holy Sprit.  On Second missionary journey, drops off Aquilla and Priscilla.

Acts 14:24-28

> Jew named Apollo.  Had been instructed in the way of the Lord. Knew only baptism of John...proving from the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ

Acts 19:1

>While Apollos was in Corinth. Paul took interior road (3rd Journey - has with him since Lystra = Timothy)

Acts 20:31

>Be on your guard. For 3 years I have never stopped warning you with tears. 

Acts 19:22

> Timothy stayed in Asia and pastors the church

II tim 4:11-13

>Only Luke with mith me. Get Mark. I sent Tichicus to Ephesus.

### Mary Mother of Jesus

On the cross, Jesus says"  "John behold you mother, Mother, behold your son." 

Two theories regarding later life of Mary mother of Jesus

- Came with John to XXX
- Jesus's brothers took care of her.


### Aphrodesian Theater

Aprodesian theater: Built in 2c AD and could hold 1750 people in Bouleterion. Constructed in Hellenistic period (Begins with Alexander the Great 334BC ff). Bouleterion used for meeting of boule = city council, during which time only council members could enter. Otherwise could be used as Odeon (lecture hall)
 
 Acts 19: 
 
Paul spends 18 Months in Corinth -> Ephesius.  Leaves Priscilla and Aquilla
 
 Apollos - needs to hear about holy spirit -> receives Holy Spirit -> goes elsewhere
 
 
 Acts 19:1  
 
 >Apollos at Corinth. Paul took road through interior to Ephesus.  Have you heard of Holy Sprit>  -> Jhn's Baptism.  thhey were baptized in name of Jesus and holy spirit am on them and they spoke in tongues and prophesized
 
John (the Baptizer)'s mission was a baptism of repentence in order to prepare the way for the Messiah.  Events of Acts 19 occur during Paul's third missionary journey (54-55AD), 25 yeaers after resurrection  - people still are talking about John's baptism. _John's ministry must have had a profound impact_, as the gospel of Jesus had still not been procolaimed in Ephesus.

- First journey 46-48
 
- Acts 15 council 49-50
 
- 2nd Journey 50-53
 
- Third journey 53-54-57 AD.

## False teaching a major problem in Ephesus
 
## Sorcery

Seven sons of Sceva

> Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?
 
Ephesus was the center of magic in the Roman empire.  Curses, Voodoo, incantations. Paul has a power that is coming from a different source of power. Drachama = 1 days wage.  When sorcers burn their scrolls, 50,000 drachamas went up in flames.  What a way to start a church! The healing through handkerchiefs only happens in Ephesus - perhaps becase the citizens were open to supernatural powers. Sorcery is NOT cult worship (of emporers or GrecoRoman gods).
 
## Artemesian Temple

Four times size of Parthenon.  400+ feet long, 200+ feet wide, with forest of 127 columns. Temple had several functions:
 
 - Destination for pilgrims
 - Banking
 - Governmental inscriptions
 - Asylum
 - Debtors
 - Poor and Needy
 
 Artemesian cult controlled 70,000 acres of agriculture.  Alexander offered money to help rebuild. 1000s of pilgrims came for Spring festival of Artemis
 
 At new testament time, temple was seventh one built on the site, having been rebuilt and removated multiple times.
 
Located at site of meteroite falling. Traditional birthplace behined moutn Paresis.
 
July 21, 356 BC  Herostratus  burned down temple with oil lamps and rags July 21, 356BC (Alexnder the Great's birthday). Rulers banned use of his name.  "Herostatic fame" is now in common parlance. Dishonoring that goddess would let  the temple burn.   Date is birthdate of Alexander the Great. "Back Storu? goddess left her post to attend the birth of Alexander the Great 

Richest sancuary apart for oracle at Delphi

Ortesia - sacred grove where Artemis was born, described as "paradise" = paradeisos

Acts 19:

>There arose a great disturbance about The Way.  Demetrius a silversmith brought in no little business for the skilled wrokers "You know, that we received a good business, and how Paul has convinced... practically the whole province of Asia. 

Acts 19

>They shouted for two hours: "Great is Artemis" in the theater 

Preitanus (City Clerk) quieted the crowd.  (It took him two hours to get there)

>People of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that Ephesus is neocorus of the temple of Artemis and her image that fell from heaven. Since these facts are undeniable.

>Though they have neither robbed tamples or blasphemed...

>IF then, Demetrius and his associates have a grievance, they can bring it to the procounsel. 

>As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting, since there is no reason for it. With that, he dismissed the assembly. 

Paul was having a massive impact on the city, not by tearing down their gods, but by evelating the gospel.
