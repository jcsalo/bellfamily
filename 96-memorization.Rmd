# Scripture memorization

With memorization: scripture is always available and "inside"


1) Find arc and movement of the story line. Read several times

2) Memorize images of lines of scripture on the bible page

3) Speak it 7 times outloud - ready to go on to next verse

4) Break up into chunks, then repeat chunks together

5) when tricky- draw a picture or acronym (especially for lists)

6) Motions with hands to remember what's next. Muscle memory for motions

7) Memory temple

Beatitudes:

- Poor in spirit (dust on head)
- Mourn - (tear)
- Humble (no nose in the air)
- Hungry (mouth)
- Merciful (no grabbing the neck)
- Peacemakers (hands)
- Persecuted (sawn in half)

8) Memory is a muscle

9) Hebrew has a cadence when reciting.  Look for rhythmn and beat.

10) No substitution for repetition 

11) Scriptures tend to be visual (Psalm 1 - Walk -> sit -> stand)
