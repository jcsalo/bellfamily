# Introduction {#intro}



<!--chapter:end:01-intro.Rmd-->

# Colossae

## Geography

Mount Cadmus is source of water

## Culture

Red-purple dye =  Colossinus

## History

Tell not yet excavated

480BC Xerxes (Persian) invaded

Leading city 5/6 Century BC

300BC Heropolis built

60 AD - Earthquake decimated

5/6 Century AC -> people moved out

## Biblical References
Paul took road through interior to Ephesus on 3rd missionary journey
Paul never met Colossains
Letter written by Paul from Rome - Delivered by Tichichus

## Ephesians 4: Instructions to Families

### Domestic Relationships in Roman culture

Aristotle Politics: Household management in its perfect form: master + slave, husband + wife, 

449BC - Law on 12 Tablets

Pater Familia - held power of life and death for household members

### Ephesians 4

Paul didn't invent Roman household code. Instructions are given first to wives, then husbands (pater familias), then children.  Addressing wives first was unheard of in Roman society.

### Marriage types

- With the hand - Man brings a women into his home (and she is subject to him) - 50%
- without the hand - Wife is not under husband's authority

### Instructions to husbands

Husbands - Agapao - love without expecting anything in return. This was revolutionary in Roman culture, which was highly transactional. Many marriages were politically expedient

Work for master - LORD: Kuios

### Slavery 

Paul couldn't abolish slavery, as the whole economy of the Roman Empire depended upon slavery.

### Instructions to children

Children - when asked to obey - assumes agency

## Sebastieon 

### Aphrodite

- Goddess of Love. Usually depicted as sensual

- Mother Goddess. Statue found in Temple to Aphodite portrays her as mother godess (in full length dress)

Sebastos = venerable one = Greek version of Augustun

The Sebasteion, excavated in 1979-81, was a grandiose temple complex dedicated to Aphrodite and the Julio-Claudian emperors . Its construction stretched over two generations, from c. AD 20 to 60, from the reign of Tiberius to that of Nero. The complex was paid for by two prominent Aphrodisian families. It consisted of a Corinthian temple and a narrow processional avenue (90 x 14 m) flanked by two portico-like buildings, each three-storeyed (12 m high), with superimposed Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders. These North and South Buildings, which defined the processional avenue, carried marble reliefs in their upper two storeys for their whole length. The reliefs were framed by the columnar architecture so that the two facades looked like closed picture-walls. Some 200 reliefs were required for the whole project, and more than 80 were recovered in the excavation. They featured Roman emperors, Greek myths, and a series of personified ethne or 'nations' of Augustus' world empire, from the Ethiopians of eastern Africa to the Callaeci of western Spain[link](http://aphrodisias.classics.ox.ac.uk/sebasteion.html)

Temple to Aphrodite and Julio-Claudian emporers (except Caligula)

Reliefs recounted the deeds of the emperor.

Poema = Work of poetra

Eph 2:8-10 

>For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.

We are God's Sebastien - recounting of his deeds

>“Do you know what it means that you are God’s workmanship? What is art? Art is beautiful, art is valuable, and art is an expression of the inner being of the maker, of the artist. Imagine what that means. You’re beautiful, you’re valuable, and you’re an expression of the very inner being of the Artist, the divine Artist, God Himself. You see, when Jesus gave Himself on the Cross, He didn’t say, “I’m going to die just so you know I love you.” He said, “I’m going to die, I’m going to bleed, for your splendor. I’m going to re-create you into something beautiful. I will turn you into something splendid, magnificent. I’m the Artist; you’re the art. I’m the Painter; you’re the canvas. I’m the Sculptor; you’re the marble. You don’t look like much there in the quarry, but I can see. Oh, I can see!” Jesus is an Artist!” And you beloved are His crowning achievement, His masterpiece!^[Tim Keller]

How do our lives (and deeds) communicate a message about who God is?

# Sardis
Saturday Sept 18th morning

## Gospel of John

- Written to Asia

## Vineyards

Jn


Ancient vineyards run along the ground.  In contact with ground, grapes can become contaminated with fungus (grape smut?) which stunts their growth

Modern vineyards raise the vines off the ground on wires.

Vinedresser in ancient times if they found contaminated grapes, wound life up vines on a rock on on a forked stick in order to allow the sun to dry off the grapes and combat grape fungus.


Every branch that bears fruit the vinedresser prunes, that it will bear more fruit.

Pruning cuts off leaves 

- Allows sun to get to other leaves
- Permits directing nutrients



=> We need to trim the good things in our lives to make energy for the great things.

Requires being clear on who you are and what you are uniquely called (and gifted) to do

"Good to Great" - Enemy of great is good

Brad Gray - As a candidate for a pastoral job - re-wrote the job description and handed it back go searach committee.

Look at how many times Jesus disppointed those around him (people he didn't heal). "That is why I have been sent"

Imperative : __remain in me__

## What are the fruit

### Good works

You will know (false prophets) by their fruit - Can bramble bear good fruit?

### Fruits of the Spirit

Character as evidenced by good deeds





## John 15-17

Where do the events in these chapters take place?

John 14: Let us leave (Upper Room)

John 18 - Jesus left -> corssed the Kidron Valley
Perhaps they left the Eastern Gate after leaving the temple, which would lead to the garden (also referred to as Geshsemene).

### Did John 15-17 take place in the Temple

Temple was left unlocked during passover (so that the Messiah wouldn't be locked out of the temple)

Jesus was the new Moses

# Pergamum

$ /pi /epsilon /rho /gamma /alpha /mu /omega /sigma $ = Height / Elevation / Citadel




## Geography

Not a port city

Located on a mountain - easily defendable.  No steep cliff like Sardis

## History

Settlement 8th Century BC

Controlled by Alexander the great.

After Alexander's death, empire split among Alexander's generals.

  - Lysimachus takes control of western Asia 
  - Celecus takes control of territories to the East
  - Celuces attacks Lysimicus in order to expand his territody
  - Philestaerus - steward of the city of Pergamum for Lysimicus:  Switches sides to Celecus just prior to the battle for Pergamum.
  - Celecus wins and rewards philestra, who became wealthy
  
  Philestaerus becomes first Attelid kings. 
  
  212 BC:  Alliance of Rome and Attalus I attacks Antiochus III the Great and wins. Rome allows Attalus to keep control of Pergamum (as they were skeptical that they could control a large modern city.)
  
190 BC Battle of Magnasia

189 BC Treaty of Apamea

133 BC

129 BC Pergamum become capitol of province of Asia. 150 AD Ephesus is on the ascendency and overshadows Pergamum. Ephesus has a port, which Pergamum does not.

31 BC Octavian defeats Mark Anthony i Battle of ___.

29 BC Pergamum asks Octavian to allow it to be the first city to construct a temple for emperor worship.  Octavian agrees, on the condition that temples are also constructed at Ephesus and Nicea to Roma and ___.

### Ius Gladii

Only Roman governors and the emperor were given the right of the sword, meaning the power to execute capital punishment. Roman legionnaires carried a double-egded sword.  Emporer carried a pear-shaped sword ( to emphasize their power of life and death).  Usual mechanism of capital punishment was the gladiatorial ring.





## Throne of Satan

Sites of pagan worship in Pergamum which might be candidates for "Throne of Satan":

### Temple of Zeus


### Temple of Athena

### Trajan Temple

Built 98-117 AD for emperor worship.

Original temple built in 29 BC for emperor worship has not been found.

26 AD 2nd temple built for Smyrna - Neocordis for Tiberius. This means that for 50 years, Pergamum was leading site for emperor worship.

98 AD Trajan selects Pergamum as site for construction of temple for emperor worship. Supported by Arches (similar to Herod supporting Temple in Jerusalem)

Ephesians 1-3: Chritian identity.  Chapters 4-6: Christian behavior.  Fits pattern of identity -> Calling -> Conduct.

Our fight is not against flesh and blood.

Armour of God is defensive

Roman soldiers forbidden to protect hamstrings (so that they would not be comofrtable running away from the enemy).

Need a community to stand firm

### Temple to Dionysus

Theater began in ancient Greece

Springtime festival: Dionysus was recurrected from the dead each spring. Dionysus was patron saint of theater and the arts.

# Scripture memorization

With memorization: scripture is always available and "inside"


1) Find arc and movement of the story line. Read several times

2) Memorize images of lines of scripture on the bible page

3) Speak it 7 times outloud - ready to go on to next verse

4) Break up into chunks, then repeat chunks together

5) when tricky- draw a picture or acronym (especially for lists)

6) Motions with hands to remember what's next. Muscle memory for motions

7) Memory temple

Beatitudes:

- Poor in spirit (dust on head)
- Mourn - (tear)
- Humble (no nose in the air)
- Hungry (mouth)
- Merciful (no grabbing the neck)
- Peacemakers (hands)
- Persecuted (sawn in half)

8) Memory is a muscle

9) Hebrew has a cadence when reciting.  Look for rhythmn and beat.

10) No substitution for repetition 

11) Scriptures tend to be visual (Psalm 1 - Walk -> sit -> stand)
