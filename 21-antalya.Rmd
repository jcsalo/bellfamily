There arose a great disturbance about The Way.  Demetrius a silversmith brought in small little business for the skilled wrokers "You know, that we received a good business, and how Paul has convinced... practically the shole province of Asia . 

Acts 19

>They shouted for two hours: "Great is Artemis" in the theater 

Preitanus (City Clerk) quieted the crowd.  (It took him two hours to get there)

People of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that Ephesus is neocorus of the temple of Artemis and her image that fell from heaven. Since these facts are undeniable.

Though they have neither robbed tamples or blasphemed...

IF then, Demetrius and his associates have a grievance, they can bring it to the procounsel. 

As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting, since there is no reason for it. With that, he dismissed the assembly. 

Paul was having a massive impact on the city, bot by tearing down their gods, but by evelating the gospel.
