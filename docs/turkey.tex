Acts 13:xx-xx

\begin{quote}
``Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen. 17 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. 18 And for about forty years he put up with{[}b{]} them in the wilderness. 19 And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance. 20 All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. 21 Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. 22 And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, `I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.' 23 Of this man's offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised. 24 Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 25 And as John was finishing his course, he said, `What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
26 ``Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation. 27 For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. 28 And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed. 29 And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. 30 But God raised him from the dead, 31 and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. 32 And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, 33 this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm,
```You are my Son,today I have begotten you.'
Ad as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way,```I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'
Therefore he says also in another psalm, ```You will not let your Holy One see corruption.'
For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption, 37 but he whom God raised up did not see corruption. 38 Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, 39 and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. 40 Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:```Look, you scoffers,be astounded and perish;
for I am doing a work in your days, work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.'\,''
\end{quote}

Is 49:6

\begin{quote}
``It is too light a thing that you should be my servant
to raise up the tribes of Jacob
and to bring back the preserved of Israel;
I will make you as a light for the nations,
that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.''

\begin{quote}
But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.
\end{quote}

Paul wasnt giving up!

\begin{quote}
42 As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath. 43 And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God. The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. 45 But when the Jews{[}d{]} saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him. 46 And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, ``It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles. 47 For so the Lord has commanded us, saying,
```I have made you a light for the Gentiles,
that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'\,''
48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. 49 And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region. 50 But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. 51 But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium. 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

Sebastos = venerable one = Greek version of Augustun

The Sebasteion, excavated in 1979-81, was a grandiose temple complex dedicated to Aphrodite and the Julio-Claudian emperors . Its construction stretched over two generations, from c.~AD 20 to 60, from the reign of Tiberius to that of Nero. The complex was paid for by two prominent Aphrodisian families. It consisted of a Corinthian temple and a narrow processional avenue (90 x 14 m) flanked by two portico-like buildings, each three-storeyed (12 m high), with superimposed Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders. These North and South Buildings, which defined the processional avenue, carried marble reliefs in their upper two storeys for their whole length. The reliefs were framed by the columnar architecture so that the two facades looked like closed picture-walls. Some 200 reliefs were required for the whole project, and more than 80 were recovered in the excavation. They featured Roman emperors, Greek myths, and a series of personified ethne or `nations' of Augustus' world empire, from the Ethiopians of eastern Africa to the Callaeci of western Spain\href{http://aphrodisias.classics.ox.ac.uk/sebasteion.html}{link}

``Do you know what it means that you are God's workmanship? What is art? Art is beautiful, art is valuable, and art is an expression of the inner being of the maker, of the artist. Imagine what that means. You're beautiful, you're valuable, and you're an expression of the very inner being of the Artist, the divine Artist, God Himself. You see, when Jesus gave Himself on the Cross, He didn't say, ``I'm going to die just so you know I love you.'' He said, ``I'm going to die, I'm going to bleed, for your splendor. I'm going to re-create you into something beautiful. I will turn you into something splendid, magnificent. I'm the Artist; you're the art. I'm the Painter; you're the canvas. I'm the Sculptor; you're the marble. You don't look like much there in the quarry, but I can see. Oh, I can see!'' Jesus is an Artist!''

Love others as yourself (contrary to transactional relationship in Roman society).

Caring for others (adoption of infants exposed and those abandoned in the market).

Sexual ethic of Christians was different from roman society

Treatment of women and children and slaves. Women were seen as more than object of male gratification.

No longer male/female, master/slave, Jew/Greek - both in justification and in dignity.

Genesis - God created us in his image: male and female.

Major beef with Christians:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Destruction of social order. Roman economy was based upon slavery. Spartacus in 73BC broke out of gladiator in Capua near bay of Naples and led a slave revolt. Two motivations: median averages - Amassed 90,000 people who joined revolt, most slaves rescued from country villas. Fort was on Mount Vesuvius. He gave dignity to slaves. 71BC Crassus put down revolt -\textgreater{} crucified 6000 rebels along Appian way. Communicated message about revolt and giving dignity to slaves.
\item
  Redefined power. If you sacrifice to Cesar, you give to him. If you worship Jesus, he will sacrifice for you.
\item
  As Roman society decayed, divinity of emporers started to make less sense. Tiberius - last 10 years he abrogates responsibility and leaves Sejanus in charge and Tiberius departs for a life of debauchery. Local governors (such as Pilate) needed to take more responsibility. Caligula. Problem with assassinating a diving ruler. Augustus was golden age of empire (44 years of peace, then dies a natural death).
\item
  Tangible power of the Christian community, in contrast to distant deity of the emperor. House churches: unity and ?underground economy in Thyatira, to avoid participation in guilds. Broke bread together. Studying together. Mutual prayer. Evangelizing. Singing together.
\end{enumerate}

Minority report (Tom Hanks)

Similar to what was happening at aescalypeon in Ephesus. Was there a dark magic operating?

Oracles in ancient world: 3/6 are in Asia Minor.

Acts 20:20 I have taught you publicly from house to house.

Acts 20:27 I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God

Acts 20:33 I have not coveted anyone silver, gold, or clothing.

Mystery =/= secret. Secret is intended to be kept hidden, but a mystery is intended to be revealed over time.

Oracle was a central fact of Roman culture known throughout Asia Minor. People travelled long distances in order to hear from the gods to ask important questions.

Acts 20

\begin{quote}
(end of Paul's third missionary journey): Trying to get to Jerusalem in time for Pentacost.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Arrived at Miletas. (Paul had decided to avoid Ephesus to arrive in Jerusalem by Pentacost.
\end{quote}

Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church. When they arrived, Paul said: You know howI lieved the whole time I ws with you,from the first itme I entered the provicne of Asia I served the lord with great humility despite the plots of the Jews, but taught you publically from house to house. I have proclaimed to Jews and Greeks that they need to place their faith in jesus. But the spirit warns me\ldots{} But my only aim is to finish the race adn complete the task the Lord has given me, the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace. I know none of you will ever see me again.Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of anyone' blood. I have given you the whole counsel of God. Be shepherds of the church of God. Even from youor own number, soe will arrive, so be on your guard. Remember that for three years I never stopped warning you night and day with tears. I have not coveted anyone's silver, or gold or clothes. In everything I did, I worked to help the weak\ldots{} It is more blessed to give than to receive.

Admonish with tears

Be shephers of the church - a group of peole leading another group of people

Every where I go, the spirit warns me that hardship is headed my way.

I held nothing back

No retirement from Kingdom work
