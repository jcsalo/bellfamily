And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. 15 After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it. 16 So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: 6.3 Paul and Barnabas switch roles 6.3.1 Aristotlean Rhetoric Resortium - INtroduction Narratio - Background (vv 17-25) Propositio - Thesis (v26) Probato - Evidence (vv27-37) 5: Piratio - Closing argumentn (vv38-41) Paul was made to bring the gospel to the gentiles. Acts 13:xx-xx Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen. 17 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. 18 And for about forty years he put up with[b] them in the wilderness. 19 And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance. 20 All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. 21 Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. 22 And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will. 23 Of this mans offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised. 24 Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 25 And as John was finishing his course, he said, What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie. 26 Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation. 27 For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. 28 And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed. 29 And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. 30 But God raised him from the dead, 31 and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. 32 And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, 33 this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, You are my Son,today I have begotten you. Ad as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way,I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David. Therefore he says also in another psalm, You will not let your Holy One see corruption. For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption, 37 but he whom God raised up did not see corruption. 38 Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, 39 and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. 40 Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:Look, you scoffers,be astounded and perish; for I am doing a work in your days, work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you. Is 49:6 It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel; I will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.

Acts 14:21 But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. Paul wasnt giving up! 42 As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath. 43 And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God. The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. 45 But when the Jews[d] saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him. 46 And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles. 47 For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth. 48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. 49 And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region. 50 But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. 51 But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium. 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

He gave land grands in Pisidian Antioch to retired soldiers. Herod and Caesar shared the same worldview, but Herod was hemmed in by the territory of Israel 10.2 Geography Founded 3C BC to protect major roads. Roman roads were critical for rapid movement of troops. In peacetime, roads provided rapid travel. 6BC Via Sebaste built between Pisidian Antioch and Perga (port city on the coast).

Sparticus lead a slave revolt in XXX. Emporer realized that social mobility would be necessary to give some hope to slaves and prevent another slave revolt. Manumission was the process of freeing a slave, in which the slave would become a client of the former owner. Urban slaves were better off than the rural poor (freeman) because of the protection of the patron. This gave more social mobility to Roman society compared with Greek society, where once a slave you were always a slave. Early church considered all social classes equal in standing before God, which threatened the established social order of Rome. 10.5 Eastern Frontier Eastern frontier was a treat to Rome, both from Jewis uprising in Israel and the Parthians. Herod was instrumental in defending eastern frontier. 40BC Parthians had installed Antigonis. Herod fled to Rome to ask for help. Herodian built as a memorial. Antonian fortress - Herod was friends with Mark Anthony. When Caesar Agustus defeated Mark Anthony in 30BC Herod went over to Augustus. 10.6 Revelations Written to the persecuted church - Written in code so that the Romans wouldnt decipher.

Its construction stretched over two generations, from c. AD 20 to 60, from the reign of Tiberius to that of Nero. The complex was paid for by two prominent Aphrodisian families. It consisted of a Corinthian temple and a narrow processional avenue (90 x 14 m) flanked by two portico-like buildings, each three-storeyed (12 m high), with superimposed Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders. These North and South Buildings, which defined the processional avenue, carried marble reliefs in their upper two storeys for their whole length. The reliefs were framed by the columnar architecture so that the two facades looked like closed picture-walls. Some 200 reliefs were required for the whole project, and more than 80 were recovered in the excavation.

In contact with ground, grapes can become contaminated with fungus (grape smut?) which stunts their growth. Modern vineyards raise the vines off the ground on wires.

Caring for others (adoption of infants exposed and those abandoned in the market). Sexual ethic of Christians was different from roman society Treatment of women and children and slaves. Women were seen as more than object of male gratification. No longer male/female, master/slave, Jew/Greek - both in justification and in dignity. Genesis - God created us in his image: male and female. Major beef with Christians: Destruction of social order. Roman economy was based upon slavery. Spartacus in 73BC broke out of gladiator in Capua near bay of Naples and led a slave revolt. Two motivations: median averages - Amassed 90,000 people who joined revolt, most slaves rescued from country villas. Fort was on Mount Vesuvius.

In the same way, after the supper he took the cup. At the heart of Jesus message is sacrifice for others. In this way you celebrate the Lords death until he comes.

He knew that the father had put all things under his. He got up and began to wash the disciples feet. Jesus bends a knee as he washes his feet. A rabbi would never wash the feet of his students. Jesus had put Peter in the servants position. John is in seat of predominance. Peter should have washed everyones feet, and Jesuss washing of feet is a sign Peter had missed his responsibility John 13: -17 when he had finished washing. Do you understand what I have done? You call me teacher and Lord, Now that I have washed your feet, you should wash one anothers feet. No servant is greater than is master, nor a messanger than the one who sent.
