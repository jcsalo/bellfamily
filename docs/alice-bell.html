<p>Alice Bell was born July 30, 1923 to Carrie Cox Bell and John William Bell on a farm in Boone County, Indiana adjacent to her grandfather Bell’s farm. Subsequent to the death of her great-grandfather on her mother’s side, Clark Millikan, her family moved to a farm in Hamilton County outside Sheridan, Indiana.

<p>Carrie’s grandfather Clark Millikan had owned a farm in Hamilton County, Indiana since 1865. After Clark’s death in 1926, an 80-acre parcel was offered for sale. John and Carrie Bell sold the farm in Boone County and moved to Clark’s farm in 1929. John and Carrie Bell took out a mortgage to purchase the farm in Hamilton County. Over the years, it bothered Carrie quite severely to carry a debt, even for the farm. They subsequently bought an additional 17 acre triangle, to make a total of 97 acres.</p>
