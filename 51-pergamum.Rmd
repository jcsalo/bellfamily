After Alexander's death, empire split among Alexander's generals.

  - Seleucus takes control of territories to the East
  - Seleucus attacks Lysimicus in order to expand his territody
  - Philestaerus - steward of the city of Pergamum for Lysimicus:  Switches sides to Seleucus just prior to the battle for Pergamum.
  - Seleucus wins and rewards Philestra, who became wealthy, and first Attelid king.

  212 BC:  Alliance of Rome and Attelus I attacks Antiochus III the Great and wins. Rome allows Attelus to keep control of Pergamum (as they were skeptical that they could control a large modern city.)

189 BC Treaty of Apamea

133 BC Antiochus III wills his empire to ROme

129 BC Pergamum become capitol of province of Asia. 150 AD Ephesus is on the ascendency and overshadows Pergamum. Ephesus has a port, which Pergamum does not.

31 BC Octavian defeats Mark Anthony at Battle of ___.

29 BC Pergamum asks Octavian to allow it to be the first city to construct a temple for emperor worship.  Octavian agrees, on the condition that temples are also constructed at Ephesus and Nicea to Roma and Julius Caesar.

### Ius Gladii

Only Roman governors and the emperor were given the right of the sword, meaning the power to execute capital punishment. Roman legionnaires carried a double-egded sword.  Emporer carried a pear-shaped sword ( to emphasize their power of life and death).  Usual mechanism of capital punishment was the gladiatorial ring.

## Throne of Satan

Sites of pagan worship in Pergamum which might be candidates for "Throne of Satan":

### Temple of Zeus

### Temple of Athena

### Trajan Temple

Built 98-117 AD for emperor worship.

Original temple built in 29 BC for emperor worship has not been found.

26 AD 2nd temple built for Smyrna - Neokorus for Tiberius. This means that for 50 years, Pergamum was leading site for emperor worship.

98 AD Trajan selects Pergamum as site for construction of temple for emperor worship. Platform for temple supported by Arches (similar to arches supporting Herod's Temple in Jerusalem)

### Letter to Ephesians

Ephesians 1-3: Christian identity.  Chapters 4-6: Christian behavior.  Fits pattern of identity -> Calling -> Conduct. 

> Our fight is not against flesh and blood.

Armour of God is defensive

Roman soldiers forbidden to protect hamstrings (so that they would not be comofrtable running away from the enemy).

Need a community to stand firm similar to how Roman soldiers were able to create a strong defensive position by interlocking their shields ("tortus")

### Temple to Dionysus

Theater began in ancient Greece

Springtime festival: Dionysus was resurrected from the dead each spring. Dionysus was patron saint of theater and the arts.
