Sebastos = venerable one = Greek version of Augustun

The Sebasteion, excavated in 1979-81, was a grandiose temple complex dedicated to Aphrodite and the Julio-Claudian emperors . Its construction stretched over two generations, from c.~AD 20 to 60, from the reign of Tiberius to that of Nero. The complex was paid for by two prominent Aphrodisian families. It consisted of a Corinthian temple and a narrow processional avenue (90 x 14 m) flanked by two portico-like buildings, each three-storeyed (12 m high), with superimposed Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders. These North and South Buildings, which defined the processional avenue, carried marble reliefs in their upper two storeys for their whole length. The reliefs were framed by the columnar architecture so that the two facades looked like closed picture-walls. Some 200 reliefs were required for the whole project, and more than 80 were recovered in the excavation. They featured Roman emperors, Greek myths, and a series of personified ethne or `nations' of Augustus' world empire, from the Ethiopians of eastern Africa to the Callaeci of western Spain\href{http://aphrodisias.classics.ox.ac.uk/sebasteion.html}{link}

Eph 2:8-10

\begin{quote}
For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.
\end{quote}

We are God's Sebastien - recounting of his deeds

\begin{quote}
``Do you know what it means that you are God's workmanship? What is art? Art is beautiful, art is valuable, and art is an expression of the inner being of the maker, of the artist. Imagine what that means. You're beautiful, you're valuable, and you're an expression of the very inner being of the Artist, the divine Artist, God Himself. You see, when Jesus gave Himself on the Cross, He didn't say, ``I'm going to die just so you know I love you.'' He said, ``I'm going to die, I'm going to bleed, for your splendor. I'm going to re-create you into something beautiful. I will turn you into something splendid, magnificent. I'm the Artist; you're the art. I'm the Painter; you're the canvas. I'm the Sculptor; you're the marble. You don't look like much there in the quarry, but I can see. Oh, I can see!'' Jesus is an Artist!'' And you beloved are His crowning achievement, His masterpiece!\footnote{Tim Keller}

Ancient vineyards run along the ground. In contact with ground, grapes can become contaminated with fungus (grape smut?) which stunts their growth

Modern vineyards raise the vines off the ground on wires.

Vinedresser in ancient times if they found contaminated grapes, wound life up vines on a rock on on a forked stick in order to allow the sun to dry off the grapes and combat grape fungus.

Every branch that bears fruit the vinedresser prunes, that it will bear more fruit.
